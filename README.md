# COVID-nomics

## Motivation

COVID-19 has been the defining crisis of the last several decades.  There will be countless studies, analyses, and debate for years to come...and I can't wait that long.  My aim is to utilize data from a new public database, built using anonymized private sector data to examine the economic impact of COVID-19 here in the US from the outbreak till now (or a relatively recent now).  This database provides a real-time picture of indicators as employment rates, consumer spending, and job postings from varying income groups, industries and counties across the country.  
I may also want to overlay what was happening in my life during this economic downturn to maybe bring it back to earth.  
The idea to create this database can be found here: https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tracker_paper.pdf  
The origins of the data for this project can be found here: https://tracktherecovery.org/
